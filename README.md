# CS2 Review

This is an in-class programming exercise aimed at refreshing you on CS2 concepts,
as well as getting you more familiar with your development environment.

## Programming Environment Setup

We will set up programming environment our our own computer, by following [Setup Tutorial](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/).

- The _Commannd Line Tools_ are required.

- The _C++ Dev Environment_ (VSCode) is highly recommened.

**Please follow these tutorials closely and carefully.**

### Devconatiner Setup

Alternatively, either:

- Follow the [VSCode Devcontainer Setup Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) and run using Docker locally
- Launch this repo in a GitHub Codespace, and copy your file into the auto grader...

## Programming Requirement

A code skeleton is given for this. From your terminal (mac or WSL/Ubunto) window, you can use the following command to download it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CISC2200-Fall-24-Fordham/CS2-Review.git
```

Consult the `TODO` sections for what you need to implement.

## Submission

This serves as a CS2 review section, and is not due for submission.
